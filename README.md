<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The aim of the project was to do a few things that would allow Esch-Belval to be presented in an interactive and intuitive way. 

We therefore decided to develop an Android application, and to implement a Map and a StreetView with clickable Markers.
This allows you to have an overview of the city, its main buildings as well as to see what the city looks like from the StreetView, and even the interior of the buildings!
(We made a custom BuildingView, so you can see the buildings as if you were walking through them!).

This project will have made us work in a lot of fields: Design / Interaction Design, application development, creation of a mascot, a logo etc ...
This project was carried out as part of the 4th semester of the BINFO program at the University of Luxembourg.

The team of this project thanks you in advance for your interest in its application. Do not hesitate to contact us for any request!

### Built With

To start the project, check the configuration of your Android Studio IDE!
Some libraries, plugins and more must be incorporated into your IDE! If you are watching this project long after it's posted, also check the versions of the plugins used in the GRADLE files.
For more information, do not hesitate to see our tutorial on this PDF document:

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This project is VERY useful for future students! 
If you are wondering about nearby stores, student accommodation, sports halls, university, libraries, university restaurants and more, you will find EVERYTHING in this app, and you can even walk around the city with the StreetView and our personalized BuildingView as if you were there!

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## What did we use?

We decided to use Android Studio, as well as the Kotlin programming language.
For the design, we used the Designer integrated in Android Studio.
Finally, for the Map, the Markers, the StreetView we used the Google libraries.
For our Building View, we created it from start to finish, taking our own photos.

For a good understanding of the code, we have correctly integrated our classes in the form of Activity, Fragment, layout etc ...

So that you can understand our project as much as possible, we have also tried to do a good code documentation!
